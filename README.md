# Roll a Ball tutorial for Unity
This is pretty much me messing around with Unity and the base tutorial that I learned how to do basic movement/controls from.

Feel free to fork and add extra stuff.

I've also added a ton of other stuff into git because I tried using gitignore.io and Unity didn't understand my project at all. It could be something incredibly obvious that I'm missing given how tired I am.
